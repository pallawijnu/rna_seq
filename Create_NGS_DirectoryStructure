#Up till now I've been frustrated because I could not automate a variety of pairing steps that occur as I process raw data to BAM files. 
#This is usually either in the SAMPE step of BWA or when I wanted to merge multiple lanes into one BAM file. I think I convinced myself 
#that I can just use the "cat" function to merge the multiple lanes together before processing, which ends up being a simple solution as
#long as all the lanes are available at the same time. For the SAMPE pairing I spent sometime with my Unix guru from France when he came 
#over to visit his wife and I seem to have a workable solution as long as a specific file tree structure is used in conjunction with two
#unix scripts, one that processes each pair from raw data to two sort BAM files, one with and without duplicates, and a second that pulls 
#each sample into the analysis framework and launches the aforementioned script. So since this requires a specific directory structure
#I've updated my directory structure script to version 3.
